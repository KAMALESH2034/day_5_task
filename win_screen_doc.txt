                              Window, Screen, and Document Objects in JavaScript
                    
JavaScript is an essential language for web development, enabling developers to create dynamic and interactive 
web pages. Three fundamental objects in JavaScript—window, screen, and document—play crucial roles in how web 
pages are accessed, displayed, and manipulated. Understanding these objects is key to mastering client-side 
scripting.

The Window Object:
------------------
The window object is the global object in the browser environment. It represents the browser window or frame,
 and all global JavaScript objects, functions, and variables automatically become members of the window object. 
 This object serves as the interface to the browser's window, allowing developers to control the browser and
  interact with the user.

Key features and methods of the window object include:

Properties:

window.innerHeight and window.innerWidth: 
    These properties return the interior height and width of the window's content area, respectively.
window.location: 
    This property returns a Location object containing information about the current URL. 
window.history: 
    Provides access to the browser's session history, allowing navigation to previous or next pages.

Methods:

window.alert(message):      
    Displays an alert dialog with the specified message.
window.confirm(message):   
     Displays a dialog with an optional message, and two buttons: OK and Cancel.
window.open(url, target, specs):
    Opens a new browser window or tab with the specified URL and window features.

The Screen Object
-----------------

The screen object contains information about the user's screen. It provides properties that describe the
 dimensions and other properties of the screen, which can be useful for optimizing the display of content 
 and improving user experience.

Key properties of the screen:

screen.width and screen.height:
     Return the width and height of the user's screen, respectively.
screen.availWidth and screen.availHeight:
     Return the available width and height of the screen, excluding system UI features like the taskbar.
screen.colorDepth:
     Returns the color depth of the screen, measured in bits per pixel.

The Document Object
--------------------

The document object represents the web page loaded in the browser. It is part of the Document Object Model (DOM),
 which is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. The document object provides methods and properties for manipulating the content and structure of the web page.

Key features and methods of the document object include:
Properties:

document.title:
     Gets or sets the title of the document.
document.body: 
    Represents the <body> element of the document.
document.URL:
     Returns the full URL of the document.

Methods:

document.getElementById(id): Returns the element with the specified ID.
document.querySelector(selector): Returns the first element that matches the specified CSS selector.
document.createElement(tagName): Creates a new element with the specified tag name.

Conclusion
The window, screen, and document objects are essential components of the browser environment in JavaScript. 
The window object serves as the global object, providing methods to control the browser window. The screen 
object provides information about the user's screen, enabling responsive and optimized content display.
 The document object represents the web page itself, offering methods to manipulate the DOM and create dynamic 
 content. Mastery of these objects is fundamental for any web developer aiming to create interactive and
  user-friendly web applications.
